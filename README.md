# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Optimization Techniques

## Overview

The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. This repository provides several methods for solving the TSP, focusing on both **Exhaustive Search** and **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**. 

## Problem Definition

Given a set of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the task is to determine the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

## Features

- **Two Optimization Approaches**: 
  - **Exhaustive Search**: A brute-force method that evaluates all possible routes to find the optimal solution.
  - **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**: A neural network approach for finding a near-optimal solution based on unsupervised learning.
  
- **Clear and Modular Code**: Code is structured in a way that allows easy extension and customization.
  
- **Visualization**: Visualize routes and compare the performance of different algorithms.

- **Reports and Analysis**: Documentation to understand the outcomes of each method.
