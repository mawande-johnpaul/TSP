## Introduction

The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is a classic optimization problem in the field of computer science and operations research. Given a list of cities and the distances between them, the task is to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. This repository provides multiple methods to solve TSP, ranging from brute-force approaches to advanced heuristic and metaheuristic techniques.

## Features

- Multiple TSP-solving algorithms are implemented.
- Provides a clear demonstration of the problem and various techniques for solving it.
- Interactive visualization for better understanding of the problem and solutions.
